<p class="one"> The film is an expirement. It is the venture into the unknown, with little to no information about what is happening. It is letting You decide on the meaning, but with the hypnotic views and unsettling music, it forces You to wander into a dark and creepy place. Yet, nothing shown is really explicit or violent, it still makes the watcher feel unsafe. A big part of this is played by the genius soundtrack produced by the one and only Hanz Simmer. The images play perfectly with the music creating an upsetting, disturbing and confusing atmosphere. That's exactly what the producers went for and undoubtably succeeded. Truly a movie of the future.</p>
