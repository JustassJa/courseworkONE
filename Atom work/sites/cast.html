<h2> Toras the dog </h2>

<p class="paragraph"> This is the best of the best. Toras was born on March 8th, 2016. That was the day when the movie industry changed as we know it. Even though he is still a youngling, his skills are not to be undermined. It is known that this absolute chad is one of a kind. As soon as this god-like champion entered the acting scene, every other dog-actor was cancelled. It is honestly no surprise, as this dog is miles ahead of its peers. It was also an honor working with such a professional. He's known for his astonishing method acting and being a gem on set. And YOU are blessed with the ability to see this legend on screen! A true professional and it's a blessing we can see him on screen!

<h2> Namuh the human </h2>

<p class="paragraph"> This is the best friend of the best dog mentioned above. He was born in year 0000 and is looking great for his age. It isn't Numahs first rodeo on set, however, he doesn't even come close to the skill that Toras has. This makes for a great dynamic on-screen, which is what we get in "Hypnosis". The sad backstory makes Numah the perfect actor for the unsettling movie. He lived through the highs and the lows of humanity itself and it is really easy to see the suffering this man has endured through the rough ages. Knowing that makes the watch an entirely different expierence. At this point Im not even sure what Im writting here, but I hope it fits. I just kinda want to make the paragraph just about the same length.
